  <h1>Welcome to Trash Coin, a meme-coin that was created for fun (1 TrashCoin = 0$). You will start with 10 TrashCoins. Type 'view' to see how much TrashCoin you have, type 'mine' to try and mine,
    type 'load' to load previous data (mining overrides previous save data if not loaded on), type 'value' to see the value of 1 mine in TrashCoins (the lower the better). The value of a mine changes randomly.
    If you run out of TrashCoin, you can still mine. You can NOT trade coins for real money (as they are worthless), please treat this just as a game, no real money is involved. 
    The mining is done by picking 3 random numbers between 0 and 10, and if they all match, you get a coin. Please use responsibly, and remember NO REAL MONEY IS OR SHOULD BE INVOLVED</h1>
